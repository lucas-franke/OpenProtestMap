# Welcome to OpenProtestMap!

OpenProtestMap is an open-source project built on top of OpenStreetMap that provides a platform for protesting groups to upload their protest locations. This platform enables protesting groups to share details about their protests, including starting points, routes, ending points, and dates, with the wider community. The platform aims to facilitate peaceful protests and help individuals exercise their right to free speech in a safe and organized manner.

This project is built on the principles of transparency and collaboration, and we encourage all users to contribute to its development. Whether you are a developer, designer, or just someone who cares about the right to protest, we welcome your contributions.

Please feel free to browse the code and submit any issues or feature requests on our GitHub repository. We look forward to your contributions and hope that OpenProtestMap can be a useful tool for activists and protestors around the world.
